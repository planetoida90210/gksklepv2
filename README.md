## Shop Product Displayer App (only tablet version) by [@planetoida90210](http://github.com/planetoida90210)!



## Hi! 

I present my app for company Galeria Koloru. This is simple displayer for hidden products in shop with basic information for each product like size of t-shirt, what is on sale right now, and mini map of Free Graffiti places where customers can scan QR Code and get navigate to specific place where they can legally paint walls in Warsaw. (redirect to jakdojade.pl). Main idea was only to create displayer for products without login and payments. But i create in different repository same app with Auth, Payments and basket. 

App is written with Next.JS and TailwindCSS.

It works good on ðŸ“± tablet - it's single app only for tablet in shop at Galeria Koloru Store.


## Thanks !
